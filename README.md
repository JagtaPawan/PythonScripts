Python scripts to automate mundane jobs


########################## loggedin.py ########################

At office many times you require to be online and do not want your system to be logged out. This would require installing some third party apps which might be blocked at Endpoint level. To avoid this, I've devloped this Python script which would keep you logged in for N amount of time.
The script would require Python 3.x installation and would keep you logged in and statsu as active till the time the script is running. 
The script would hover and move your mouse pointer from anywhere on the screen to the top-left corner and drag it 500 pixels in Y axis and also press the harmless key "Shift" after every 5 minutes/300 seconds interval. 

To escape the script press 'Ctrl + C' on your keyboard.
